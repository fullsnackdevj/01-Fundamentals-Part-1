//notes for statements and Expressions

/* 
Expression is a piece of code that produces a value.

ie: 3 + 4 is an expression, because it does produce value.

1991 is also an expression .

true && false && !false is also an expression. 

*/

// Statement is a bigger piece of code that is executed and which does not produce a value on itself.

if (23 > 10) {
  const str = "23 is bigger";
}

// expression = produces value
// statements = does not produce value

// 'Statements are like full sentences that translate our actions.
// the actions that we want the program to perform.
